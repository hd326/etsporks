    <p>Nowadays people pay more and more attention to environmental protection, and reducing the plastic pollution to the environment is the first choice of many people.</p><br>

    <p>Jay is a graphic designer as well as a product designer. Two years ago, he began to focus on designing and developing new concept kitchen utensils; at <b>present he has obtained two patents</b>. Through all his efforts, a special 4 in 1 tableware ET Spork has been launched. It combines a spoon, a fork, a knife, and a bottle opener into one utensil. Our goal is to encourage people to give up the use of disposable plastic tableware, so as to reduce plastic pollution to the earth, especially to the ocean.</p><br>

    <p>Our team member Diane is good at art design and photography. She is responsible for Et's website and product promotion. Jay and his team will continue to launch new eco-friendly products, and will continue to make a positive contribution to protecting the earthâ€™s home!</p>
